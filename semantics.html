    <h1>Foxes</h1>
    <h2>The red fox is one of the UKâ€™s most iconic species. Sadly, 70% of wild foxes do not make their first birthday, and an
    estimated 100,000 foxes are killed on UK roads, every year.
    
    Many other foxes fall victim to litter and netting, in which they get entangled.
    
    WAF rescues hundreds of foxes, every year. Some are able to be released immediately, where they have been found, and
    others will remain in our care until they make a full recovery.
    
    This work is only possible due to the public support we receive. Your fox adoption will help rescue, rehabilitate, and
    release more wild foxes.</h2>
