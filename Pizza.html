<H1>Pizza</H1>
<h2>Pizza is an Italian dish of baked bread dough topped with sauce and other ingredients. It's one of the world's most
popular foods.
History
The word "pizza" may come from an Old Italian word meaning "a point".
The term "pizza" was first recorded in 997 AD in a Latin manuscript.
Raffaele Esposito is often credited with inventing modern pizza in Naples in the 19th century.
Ingredients
Pizza is typically made with tomato-based sauce, but butter-based sauces are also used.
Common toppings include mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, sausages, vegetables, tomatoes, spices, herbs, and basil.</h2>
